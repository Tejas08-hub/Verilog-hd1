\# Full Subtractor (Verilog HDL)



This folder contains the Verilog HDL design of a Full Subtractor.



The full subtractor is implemented using \*\*two half subtractors\*\* and an OR gate.

It subtracts two 1-bit inputs along with a borrow input and produces difference and borrow outputs.



Files included:

&nbsp; full\_sub.v : Full subtractor design

&nbsp; full\_sub\_tb.v : Testbench for simulation

&nbsp; full\_sub\_02(using 2 half subtractors)

&nbsp; schematic.png : RTL schematic view

&nbsp; waveform.png : Simulation waveform output



The design is verified using simulation and waveform analysis.
